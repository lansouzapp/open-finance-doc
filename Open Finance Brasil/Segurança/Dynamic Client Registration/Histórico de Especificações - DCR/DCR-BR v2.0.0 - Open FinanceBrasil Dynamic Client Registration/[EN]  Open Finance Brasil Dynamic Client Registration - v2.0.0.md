## 5. Introduction
Brasil Open Finance ecosystem leverages a federation trust provider or directory of participants as the golden source of information on accredited participants and software that are authorized to partake in the Open Finance Brasil ecosystem.The services by the Directory include
- Software registration and management.
- Software credential registration and management using ICP Certificates.
- Software Statement Assertion (SSA) generation
Participants within the ecosystem must leverage these services to facilitate API driven OAuth client registration using the process outlined in clause 3.1.1 of [RFC7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591) with additional metadata necessary to support OpenID Connect defined in [OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html).It's important to remember that the client registration payload has most of its attributes as non-mandatory, and that assigned values that conflict with those in the software statement assertion will be overridden by the values of the software statement assertion issued by the Directory of Participants. Not all metadata a client wishes to provide may be contained in a software statement, e.g alternative [Metadata Languages and Script values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#LanguagesAndScripts). There are some cases where the client metadata are subset of the existing values in the SSA, such as redirect_URIs.

6. shall require and validate that redirect_uris matches or contains a sub set of software_redirect_uris provided in the software_statement;
7. shall require and validate that all client authentication mechanism adhere to the requirements defined in RFC7591 and RFC7592 , validating the registration_access_token and, through a secure connection, the certificate chain of ICP-Brasil;
8. removed;
9. shall validate that the requested scopes are adequate for accredited institutions and their regulatory roles and contained in the software_statement. The list of regulatory permissions and the corresponding scopes are described in the following sections;
10. where possible, shall compare client metadata asserted by a client to the metadata provided in the software_statement, choosing values in the SSA with precedence;
11. shall accept all x.500 AttributeType name strings defined in the Distinguished Name of the x.509 Certificate Profiles defined in Open Finance Brasil x.509 Certificate Standards ;

15. shall perform a recertification on OIDF FAPI and DCR after any systemic changes.
16. The value of the software_api_webhook_uris attribute contained as an attribute in the JWS in software_statement must be compared with the webhook_uris field. If the values are not exactly the same, the error must be returned, with the HTTP status code set to 400, error filled in as invalid_webhook_uris and error_description filled in with The content of the webhook_uris field different from what was Registered in the software_statement noted via the JWS software_api_webhook_uris field.
17. If the webhook_uris field is not declared in the payload, the webhook functionality shall be considered disabled for the specific client.
These provisions apply equally to the processing of [RFC7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591), [RFC7592](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592) and [OpenID Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) requests
#### 7.1.1. Applying Server Defaults
Whenever properties of a DCR request are not included nor mandatory in the specification, the Authorisation Server shall apply client defaults in the following manner:
1. shall select and apply the encryption algorithm and cipher choice from the most recommended of the IANA cipher suites that is supported by the Authorisation Server;
2. shall populate defaults from values within the software_statement assertion where possible;
3. shall grant the client permission to the complete set of potential scopes based on the softwares regulatory permissions included in the software_statement;

### 7.2. Regulatory Roles for OpenID and OAuth 2.0 Mappings
To participate in the Open Finance ecosystem, accredited institutions must register themselves in the directory of participants according to their regulatory roles. Those roles reflect the institutions authorization from the Central Bank and, consequently, the APIs they are allowed to use.The following table describes the regulatory roles for Open Finance and the related OAuth 2.0 scopes mapping. If the scopes are omitted during the DCR process, the authorization server shall grant the complete set of potential scopes based on the registering bank's regulatory roles, as described in the Server Defaults section.
| Regulatory Role | Description | Allowed Scopes | Target Phase |
| DADOS | Instituição transmissora ou receptora de dados (AISP) | openid accounts credit-cards-accounts consents customers invoice-financings financings loans unarranged-accounts-overdraft resources credit-fixed-incomes exchanges bank-fixed-incomes variable-incomes treasure-titles funds | Phase 2 and Phase 4 |
| PAGTO | Instituição prestadora de serviço de iniciação de pagamentos (PISP) | openid payments recurring-payments nrp-consents | Phase 3 |
| CONTA | Instituição detentora de conta (ASPSP) | openid | Phase 3 |
| CCORR | Correspondente de crédito | openid | Phase 3* |
It is requiread that the active roles in the application's software_statement are validated. The field _software_statement_roles shall be used for validation and currently listed roles shall be active.
## 8. Software Statement Assertion
A Software Statement Assertion (software_statement) is a JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) that asserts the metadata values of the client software as a whole. On the Open Finance Brasil structure, this software_statement is signed by the Participants Directory and it's signature MUST be validated by the Authorization Servers using the public keys available on the following session.
### 8.1. Attributes of the Software Statement Assertion (Claims)
The following example contains all attributes currently included in a software_statement:wide1800
## 9. Processing of the Dynamic Client Registration claim

### 9.1. Sending a Registration Claim with a Software Statement
This example includes several optional fields, some of those may not be applicable to some implememntations. For a complete guide to attributes and its mandate, consult the DCR Swagger [OFB-DCR/DCM-Swagger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBanking-Brasil/specs-seguranca/main/dcr_review/dcr-dcm-swagger.yaml). Line breaks inside values serve presentation purposes only.wide1800
### 9.2. Open Finance Brasil SSA Key Store and Issuer Details
The following links point to public keys of the Participant Directory and must be used to verify the signature validity of the software_statements presented during the client registration process.**Production**[https://keystore.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/openbanking.jwks](https://keystore.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/openbanking.jwks)Open Finance Open Finance Brasil production SSA issuer**Sandbox**[https://keystore.sandbox.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/openbanking.jwks](https://keystore.sandbox.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/openbanking.jwks)Open Finance Open Finance Brasil sandbox SSA issuer
### 9.3. About authentication and authorization mechanisms for DCR and DCM services
As they are auxiliary services to the main flow of Open Finance Brasil, the dynamic registration and maintenance services for clients do not use the same access control mechanisms. For example, it is not possible to require an OAuth 2.0 access_token from a client application that isn't registered yet with the transmitting institution.To extend [RFC7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591) and [RFC7592](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592), which recommend minimum mechanisms for authentication of their services, institutions that support the registration flows and dynamic maintenance of clients must implement the following controls:
#### 9.3.1. Client registration - POST /register

1. validate that the certificate presented by the client application is subordinate to the ICP-Brasil chains defined in the Open Finance Brasil Certificates Standard;
2. ensure that the signature of the software_statement_ presented by the client application during registration has been made by the Directory of Participants using the public keys described in the previous section;
3. ensure that the software_statement presented by the client application during registration corresponds to the same institution as the client certificate presented, validating it through the attributes that bring organization_id in the X.509 certificate.
4. Multiple DCR registrations for the same Software Statement should not be allowed, in a way that in case of a new registration attempt for an already registered Software Statement, the Error Response procedure defined on item 3.2.2 of the RFC7591 must be enforced.
5. issue, on the registry response, a registration_access_token to be used as an authentication token on maintaining operations of the registered client application, following specifications described in RFC7592 .

#### 9.3.2. Client Maintenance - GET /register - PUT /register - DELETE /register

1. Validate the presence and matching of the Bearer header Authorization containing the value of the registration_access_token attribute returned during registration of the corresponding client.
2. When the invoked method is PUT / register, carry out the validations of sub-items 1, 2, 3, and 5 of item Client registration - POST /register .
3. When the invoked method is GET /register, carry out the validations of sub-items 1 and 5 of item Client registration - POST /register .
4. When the invoked method is DELETE /register, carry out the validation of sub-item 1 of item Client registration - POST /register .

### 9.4. Signature certificates validation

- The directory uses cert rescan function hourly to validation process.
- The organization shall ensure that the validation process was completed.
- Each organization must have a continuity plan in case of unavailability validation service.
- If the signature certificate is not valid because it has a revoked status according to the CA’s OCSP/CRL issuer, or is inactive in the directory register, the set of public keys is moved to the inactive key storage.
- The validation process should include: Resource server (Data Transmitter) message signature validation, to be done by the Client (Data Receiver) Validate that the message was signed in line with what’s defined on the Message Signature Guidelines, including that the iss is equal to the organisation_id of the server that issued the message. Fetch the “iss” claim from the JWT and build the directory application JWKS uri for that specific server. Make sure that the kid present on the message JWT header is present on the directory JWKS. Validate that the private key for the corresponding kid is able to validate the message signature. Client (Data Receiver) message signature validation, to be done by the Resource Server Validate how the message was signed in line with what’s defined on the Message Signature Guidelines. Obtain the org_jwks_uri which was presented on the SSA by the client on the moment of the registration (DCR) Make sure that the kid present on the message JWT header is present on the directory JWKS. Validate that the private key for the corresponding kid is able to validate the message signature.
